### Problem 1.
Alice is a novice trader unaware of complex trading strategies. She randomly chooses a
 stock from the NIFTY 50 index and trades on it daily from 2023-04-01 to 2024-03-31, starting with
 an amount of Rs. 1,00,000. Being very enthusiastic, she invests her complete capital each time. She
 buys the stock at its opening price and sells at the close, the very same day. Help her evaluate the
 strategy as follows: (Assume that non-integer quantities can be traded)  
   
 (a) Her final capital  
 (b) The daily returns in percentage, the sharpe ratio and the maximum drawdown  
 (c) What would the above metrics be, had she invested in the index following the same strategy?  
 (d) Plot her capital with time on the same graph in both cases.  
 (e) Compare the two cases based on your understanding. Which one is a better option?
### Problem 2. 
Alice now wants to build a portfolio and comes to you for help choosing stocks for her. You
 have recently learned about the correlation between stocks and decided to build a portfolio based
 on it.  
 (a) Would you suggest highly correlated or uncorrelated stocks to go into the portfolio?   
 (b) Try to find 1 pair of stock from NSE each for high positive correlation (𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 ≥ 0.5), uncorrelated
 stocks (| 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 |≤ 0.1) and high negative correlation (𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 ≤ −0.5), timeframe same as Prob 1.  
 (c) Can you explain why the pair behaves so? Give examples with a reason of sectors or stocks that
 you expect to be correlated in some way.  
 ### Problem 3. 
 Moving Average is considered an important indicator of price action. You can check the
 resources for more details. Your task is to choose a stock and calculate the 10 and 20-day Simple
 Moving Average of the stock’s Closing price from 2023-04-01 to 2024-03-31. For the 20-day SMA,
 use the rolling function but code it yourself for the 10-day SMA. Now, plot the SMAs and the stock’s
 closing price on the same graph using Matplotlib.  
 (It’s completely fine if you don’t understand how the moving averages work. We will cover it next
 time. This question is just to test your coding skills.)
 ### Problem 4. (Optional) 
 You recently came across [this article](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/weekendeffect.asp) and decided to test it. Test the weekend
 effect on NIFTY50, DOW JONES, FTSE 100, and DAX; compare the results of the different world
 indices for the period, same as in Problem 3, and comment on whether the effect is true for them.
 You should compare the days based on whatever metrics you feel are suitable.
